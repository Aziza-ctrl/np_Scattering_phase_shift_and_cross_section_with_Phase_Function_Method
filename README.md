# np-Scattering-phase-shift-and-cross-section-with-Phase-Function-Method-for-two-term-Potentials
Nuclear physics is characterized by numerous experiments, including those involving nucleon-nucleon interactions. In these cases, the phase shift carries information about the behavior of this interaction depending on nucleon distance.

To find the phase shift for np system I follow the steps according to the research (O.S.K.S. Sastri et al., 2021) about the implementation of the Phase Function and Monte Carlo methods in nuclear scattering.
